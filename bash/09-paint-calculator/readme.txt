PAINT CALCULATOR

Calculate the number of gallons needed to paint a ceiling of a room. Ask for
the length and width of the room. Assume one gallon covers 30 square meters.
Remember that you can't buy half of a gallon.

Example:

What is the length of the room? 4
What is the width of the room? 10

You'll need to purchase 2 gallons of paint to cover 40 square meters.
