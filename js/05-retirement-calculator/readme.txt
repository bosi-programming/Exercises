RETIREMENT CALCULATOR

Use the computer to get what year is now, then ask the user his current age and
how old he wants to retire. The print how many years the user will have to
work, what year is now and when he'll retire.

Remember to convert to number to do the calculations.

Example:

What is your current age? 25
At what age would you like to retire? 65
You have 40 years left until you can retire.
It's 2015, so you can retire in 2055.
