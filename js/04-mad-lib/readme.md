# Mad lib

Mad libs are a simple game where you create a story temple with blanks for words and fill it with a noun, a verb, an adjective and an adverb.

Example:

Enter a noun: dog
Enter a verb: walk
Enter an adjective: blue
Enter an adverb: quickly
Do you walk your blue dog quickly? That's hilarious!
